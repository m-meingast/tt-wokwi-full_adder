# 1-bit Full Adder

## Overview

This circuit implements a 1-bit Full Adder using basic logic gates in Wokwi. Three 1-bit values (A, B and Carry In) are entered via the DIP switch. The circuit then computes the result, which is displayed
as two basic LEDs (S and Carry Out).

## Inputs

- A → Switch 1
- B → Switch 2
- C_In → Switch 3

## Outputs

- S → Out0: Result
- C_Out → Out1: Carry Out

## How to Use

Flip the DIP switches 1-3 to set the inputs of the circuit. The result is shown at the two output LEDs.
